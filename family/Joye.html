            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/Joye.E only operates when the device screen is off, at which time it uploads sensitive information from the device to remote sites.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Trojan:Android/Joye.E was briefly available on the Google Play Store under the app name 'Guger', but has since been removed.<br />
If installed, the app will wait until the device screen is off before performing any routines. When active, it monitors incoming SMS messages and deletes certain messages; it is also capable of sending SMS messages.<br />
The app can also contact remote websites (which appear to be based in mainland China), to which it can send out system configuration information for the device.<br />
The app itself is not promoted using any obvious indication of its purpose. Based on its functionality, it is suspected that the app may be a component of another malware.
