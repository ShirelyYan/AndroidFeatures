            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/HippoSms silently sends SMS messages and deletes messages from specific, service operator-related numbers.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Trojan:Android/HippoSms was found being distributed in an unofficial, Chinese third party Android app market in late July, 2011.<br />
On execution, the app sends SMS messages containing the text '=8' to numbers beginning with '10', and deletes incoming messages from numbers starting with '10' and/or '13'; both these numbers are related to mainland China-based service operators.<br />
Services and receivers related to the trojan's activities are as follow:<br />
•	.sms.BootReceiver<br />
•	.sms.MessageService<br />
•	SplashActivity<br />
•	MessageService<br />
HippoSms.A also writes code using ContentObserver to monitor changes in the SMS message contents and to trigger its SMS message deletion routine.
