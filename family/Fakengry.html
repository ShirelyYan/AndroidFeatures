            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/FakeAngry silently gathers information from the device and forwards the details to a remote location.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
FakeAngry variants are typically distributed as trojanized applications - that is, a legitimate program that have been recompiled to include malicious components. The altered app are then redistributed, either under their original branding or with new names, in order to lure unsuspecting users into downloading and installing the program. For example, the FakeAngry.A variant is distributed in a package named 'com.i22.angrybirds'.<br />
Once installed, the malicious app gathers the following information from the compromised device and forwards the details to a remote location:<br />
•	Device ID<br />
•	International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number<br />
•	International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number<br />
•	SDK version<br />
•	SIM serial number<br />
•	Subscriber ID
