            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/GoldDream variants silently collect information on SMS messages and phone calls made on the device; the collected data is forwarded to a remote location.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Once installed on a device, Trojan:Android/GoldDream will monitor incoming SMS messages; information collected related to the messages is saved in a file named 'zjsms.txt'.<br />
GoldDream will also monitor incoming and outgoing phone calls; information collected related to the calls is saved in a file named 'zjphonecall.txt'.<br />
In addition to collecting the SMS message and phone call log details, the trojan also collects the device's ID number, the subscriber ID and the SIM card's serial number. GoldDream connects to and uploads the harvested data to a remote command and control (C&C) server (hxxp : // lebar . gicp . net /zj /[...]).<br />
The trojan is able to receive the following instructions from the C&C server:<br />
•	Install/uninstall an app on the device<br />
•	Make a phone call<br />
•	Send an SMS message
