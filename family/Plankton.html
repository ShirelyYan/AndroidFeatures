            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/Plankton variants silently forward information about the device to a remote location. In addition, they download an additional file onto the device.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Once installed on a device, Trojan:Android/Plankton will forward the following details (about the Plankton app itself) to a remote server:<br />
•	ApplicationID<br />
•	DeveloperID<br />
•	DeviceID<br />
•	The permissions granted<br />
•	Device status<br />
On receiving this information, the server contacted returns a URL, from which Plankton retrieves a JAR file.<br />
In addition to collecting the details for the Plankton app, the trojan will also collect the following information:<br />
•	International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number<br />
•	Details of the device itself<br />
•	Operating system protocol version<br />
•	UserID<br />
These details are also forwarded to the remote server.<br />
Plankton variants are also able to perform the following actions on the device, among others:<br />
•	Collect the browser history<br />
•	Collect or modify the browser's bookmarks<br />
•	Install a downloaded file<br />
