            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan-Spy:Android/Smforw variants silently forward incoming SMS messages on an infected device to a remote server.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Trojan-Spy:Android/Smforw variants may be installed on a mobile device as part of the payload of a PC-based trojan, Droidpak. When this trojan infects a Windows system, it downloads a mobile app onto the machine and then attempts to install it onto any Android devices connected to the system by a USB cable. For installation to be successful, the device must have the setting 'Enable USB debugging' enabled.<br />
When installed, SMforw variants will monitor and intercept incoming SMS messages and forward them to a remote server.<br />
