            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/Gepew is installed on a mobile device as part of a PC-based malware's payload and attempts to replace installed apps with trojanized versions.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Trojan:Android/Gepew variants are reportedly installed on a mobile device as part of the payload of a PC-based trojan, Droidpak. When this trojan infects a Windows system, it downloads a mobile app onto the machine and then attempts to install it onto any Android devices connected to the system by a USB cable. For installation to be successful, the device must have the setting 'Enable USB debugging' enabled.<br />
When installed, Gepew will scan the device for installed apps associated with South Korean banks. If found, Gepew prompts the user to remove these apps; if complied with, trojanized versions of these apps are installed. The trojan may also monitor and intercept incoming SMS messages, which are forwarded to a remote server.
