            SUMMARY<br />
            Trojan:Android/Kmin variants display a message as a decoy, while silently performing multiple malicious routines, including sending SMS messages to a premium-rate number and downloading and installing an additional application onto the device.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Upon execution, variants in the Kmin trojan family display a message asking the user for a permission to proceed with a specified action; the A variant asks whether the user wishes to install a paid app and subscribe to a service, while the B and C variants only enquire whether the user would like to install a paid application.<br />
Regardless of whether the user accepts or declines, the app will proceed with the following actions:<br />
Sending the Internation Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number and phone number to a remote server<br />
Sending SMS messages to a premium-rate number<br />
Downloading and installing another application<br />
Running services in the background
