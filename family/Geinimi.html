            SUMMARY<br />
Trojan:Android/Geinimi variants harvest details of the affected device and forwards them to a remote location; they are also capable of executing remote commands on the device, such as sending SMS messages and making phone calls.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Trojan:Android/Geinimi variants were first seen in the wild in China in November 2010. The malware is distributed as a malicious executable packaged in trojanized third party applications.<br />
On executing the trojanized 'carrier'applicaiton, the malicious executable is also started as a service, which acts as a receiver to intercept incoming SMS messages.<br />
When active, Geinimi variants collect details of the infected device, such as:<br />
•	Telephone number<br />
•	Voice mail number<br />
•	International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number<br />
•	International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number<br />
•	Device hardware information<br />
•	Operator country and name<br />
•	Service provider name<br />
In addition to its data-collection routine, Geinimi is able to connect to remote servers, from which it receives encrypted commands to execute various actions on the device, such as sending SMS messages and making phone calls. As such, this is one of the most complex Android malwares found to date.
