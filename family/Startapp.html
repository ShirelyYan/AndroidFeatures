            SUMMARY<br />
Adware:Android/StartApp displays third-party advertising content to the device user, either as icons or notification messages in the device interface, or as pop-up messages that are shown when the bundled apps are run.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Mobile apps, especially those distributed for free, often include behavior or components for displaying third-party advertising content. This is done as an alternative form of revenue for the software developers, who would otherwise have to charge users for the application itself.<br />
If a user is unaware of the 'ad-supported' nature of such programs, or objects to the content being shown, they may cause considerable annoyance. If use of the program outweighs the inconvenience of having ads displayed, the user may elect to keep the program installed.
