TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
DroidSheep.A is a security testing tool that is capable of hijacking a logged-on session conducted over a shared wireless network. It is intended to demonstrate poor security properties in a network connection, but may be misused for malicious intent by irresponsible parties.<br />
While hack-tools and similar apps may be legitimately used by the device's authorized user, they are classified by security programs as riskware because in the hands of unauthorized users, they can also be used to cause damage to the user's data or the device.<br />
If you are confident that you are aware of the risks involved in using the program and consent to its use, you may choose to keep it installed on your device.
