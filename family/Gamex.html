            SUMMARY<br />
Gamex.A is a harmful program that downloads and installs files onto an infected device.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
Gamex.A hides its malicious components inside the package file. Once it is granted a root access by the device owner, it connects to a command and control (C&C) server to download more applications and to forward the device's IMEI and IMSI numbers. Additionally, it also establishes a connection to an external link which contains a repackaged APK file, and proceeds to downloading and installing the file.
