This detection from the F-Secure Security Cloud identifies Android apps with code or behavior that matches the Riskware:Android/Kingroot root tool.<br />
TECHNICAL DETAILS<br />
About Security Cloud<br />
F-Secure's Security Cloud is an online service that tracks the security reputation of common programs, files and websites. If a questionable program or file is found during a scan, your F-Secure security product will send a query to the Security Cloud to get its most recent reputation rating. The product will then use that information (and if needed, further analysis) to choose whether to block, quarantine or remove the program or file.<br />
The Security Cloud rating for the identified app indicates that it has code similar to Riskware:W32/KingRoot. This app is a root tool, or a utility program that gives users greater acess to the Android operating system than is usually permitted.<br />
While root tools and similar apps may be legitimately used by the device's authorized user, they are classified by security programs as riskware because in the hands of unauthorized users, they can also be used to cause damage to the user's data or the device.<br />
If you are confident that you are aware of the risks involved in using the app and consent to its use, you may choose to keep the app installed on your device.
